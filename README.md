This study mainly focuses on the classification of arrhythmia which is based on electrocardiogram (ECG) data by using Support Vector Machines (SVM) in addition with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). ECG data which contains critical information about the electrical activity of the heart, are analyzed to identify arrhythmias, potentially life-threatening irregular heartbeats. The high-dimensional nature of ECG signals necessitates the use of dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA, to enhance the computational efficiency and accuracy of the SVM classifier. PCA is employed to extract the most significant features from the ECG data, reducing noise and preserving essential information. Subsequently this features are fed into the SVM a robust supervised learning algorithm known for its efficacy in binary and multi-class classification problems. The proposed method demonstrates promising results, with improved classification accuracy and reduced computational complexity, making it a viable approach for real-time arrhythmia detection and diagnosis in clinical settings.
